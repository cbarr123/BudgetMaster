# BudgetMaster

BudgetMaster is a multi-user personal budgeting application that will allow users to enter expected income and expenses for the month to create a zero-balance budget. 
Upon successful registration the user will be presented with a skeleton of a budget. The user will then build out their budget for the month. 
The user will be presented with a total income and expenses in both text and graphical format.

Personal budgeting is hard. For this project I wanted to take on the challenge of creating an application that might make budgeting a little easier and also be able to adapt it to my own requirements.  I also wanted to gain experience in working with the integrated data sets that make up a budget.

Developed a multi-user personal budgeting application that will allow users to enter expected income and expenses for the month to create a zero-balance budget. After registration the user will be presented with a skeleton of a budget. The user can then build out their budget for the month. The user is then presented with a total income and expenses in both text and graphical format.
